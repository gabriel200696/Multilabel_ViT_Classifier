# Multilabel_ViT_Classifier
Multilabel Event Classifier for Power System Data

This repository contains the implementation of a multilabel classification model based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, designed to identify and categorize power system events using real synchrophasor (PMU) measurements from the Brazilian Interconnected Power System (BIPS).

The model leverages the transformerâ€™s capability to capture long-range dependencies in time-series data and combines it with customized evaluation metrics such as weighted F1-Score, Hamming Loss, and Hamming Score, specifically tailored to the characteristics of low-voltage PMU measurements.
